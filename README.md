# NavCS
Welcome to the NavCS Github repository!

NavCS is a system which utilises GPS to provide a platform for navigation games, from hide and seek around the neighbourhood with the kids to city-wide games of tag, and everything in between. The system is minimalist and to allow the users to have the freedom to do anything, anywhere.

Functionally the system (a webapp) will allow a user to create a game in their chosen mode and at their date/time of choice, then give them an access code which they can send to their friends. Once the users have joined the website will then contact the server periodically to send the location of the player, and in return the server will send the location of the target(s). When a player gets found they will press a button on their website which will adjust the points and targets accordingly.

This version of NavCS is 1.0 _[beta]_ and while it has a few bugs and minimal features you can play it [here](navcs.azurewebsites.net) to test it out. The next version (1.1) will be coming out soon and be fully ready for operation. Two Android/iOS apps will be coming out late 2023 (standard, and pro - with more features; gamemodes; and customisability), and updates will come every now and then.

Thanks, -NavCS team
