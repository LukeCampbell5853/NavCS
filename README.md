# NavCS
Welcome to the NavCS Github repository!

NavCS is a system which utilises GPS to provide a platform for navigation games, from hide and seek around the neighbourhood with the kids to city-wide games of tag, and everything in between. The system is minimalist and to allow the users to have the freedom to do anything, anywhere.

Functionally the system (a webapp) will allow a user to create a game in their chosen mode and at their date/time of choice, then give them an access code which they can send to their friends. Once the users have joined the website will then contact the server periodically to send the location of the player, and in return the server will send the location of the target(s). When a player gets found they will press a button on their website which will adjust the points and targets accordingly.

While we're still a few months away from launch we should get the bulk of the program complete in the upcoming weeks, at which point the website should be fully functional (and also the code won't be being redeployed every 5 seconds when we change something) even though we may make changes after testing.

Thanks, -NavCS team
